GVP template is designed to parse SIP Server, ORS, and MCP logs. 
You can load SIP server, ORS, and MCP logs at once.

The logs messages that are processed:

SIP Server - Tlib, SIP (INVITE, BYE)
ORS - Workflow:  Enter, Exit, Transition
MCP - Form Enter, SIP(INVITE, BYE)

Ther are three keys lists:

1.	GVP ID - shows messages from SIP Server & MCP logs
2.	ORS ID - shows messages from SIP Server & ORS logs
3.	MCP ID - shows MCP Form Enter
